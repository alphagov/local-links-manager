# Service Owners

Most services currently do not have an owner, but a service can be assigned one or more owning organisations by a user with the `GDS Editor` [permission](/docs/permissions.md). Visit the service, and select the "Update Owner" action from the sidebar. You can then enter one or more organisations by their organisation slug (the final part of their organisation URL on gov.uk, eg: 'government-digital-service' from https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-digital-service), separating organisations with a space if there are more than one.

This allows users from that department with access to Local Links Manager to edit the service as detailed in the [Permissions page](/docs/permissions.md)
